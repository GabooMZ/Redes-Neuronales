Smiles Dataset.

This dataset consists of two parts:

1.- labels.
2.- image files.

1: The labels are included in two files: SMILE_list.txt and NON-SMILE_list.txt.
Each file contains the image file names of the smile and non-smiles pictures.

The labels files were made available by Olasimbo Arigbabu (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/yz4v8tb3tp/5).

2: The actual image files can be downloaded from: http://conradsanderson.id.au/lfwcrop/

Please, download the color version lfwcrop_color.zip. Extract and copy all the ppm files into the 'faces/' directory.

For more information about the images dataset see the README.txt file in this directory.
